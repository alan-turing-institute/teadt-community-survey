Figure X: **Challenges in Building Connected Digital Twins**. The bar chart presents the results of a multiple-choice question where respondents were asked to identify the major challenges to overcome when building connected digital twins. This question was conditional on respondents having answered that they do consider sharing data/models. Participants could select multiple options from a list of pre-defined challenges, and the bars show the percentage of respondents who selected each challenge. The challenges are color-coded to suggest potential categories. While these categories help group related challenges, they are not intended to be definitive or exhaustive.

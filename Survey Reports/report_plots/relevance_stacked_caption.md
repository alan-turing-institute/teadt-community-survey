Figure X: **Relevance of Gemini Principles.** The bar chart shows how respondents rated the relevance of various Gemini principles in response to the question, "Please rate, for each of the following Gemini principles, the extent to which it focuses on issues that you believe to be relevant for your work.". Ratings were provided on a scale from "Extremely Relevant" to "Not Relevant," with green shades representing higher relevance (Extremely, Very) and yellow shades representing lower relevance (Moderately Relevant, Slightly Relevant and Not Relevant). The stacked bars indicate the percentage of respondents who selected each level of relevance for each principle.

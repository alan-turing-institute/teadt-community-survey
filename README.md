# Community Pulse Check: Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance of Digital Twins

The Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance of Digital Twins project ran from February to October 2024. It was a collaborative project between the Turing Research and Innovation Cluster in Digital Twins (Alan Turing Institute) and the Centre for Assuring Autonomy (University of York), with support from the Responsible Technology Adoption Unit (UK Department for Science, Innovation and Technology). Funding for the project was awarded by the BRAID programme (UKRI AHRC).

The Community Pulse Check is a survey that was part of the scoping research undertaken for this project. Dr. Sophie Arana led its design and delivery to help identify current attitudes, needs, and capabilities among digital twin practitioners (e.g., researchers and developers).

This survey was carried out in partnership with the Digital Twin Hub (Connected Places Catapult) given their extensive network of over 5000 members.

This repository contains materials for the Community Pulse Check project, including:

- **Results**: A report on the final results and insights from the analysis.
- **Online Data Collection**: Code and tools for survey deployment and data gathering.
- **Data Analysis**: Scripts for processing, analyzing, and visualizing the collected data.

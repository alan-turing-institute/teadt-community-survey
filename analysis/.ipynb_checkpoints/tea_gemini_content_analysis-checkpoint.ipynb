    "This notebook documents the method we applied for systematically examining the free-text data collected across four distinct survey fields. The survey fields included the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What do you understand ‘assurance’ to mean in the context of your work? (code: assurance_meaning)\n",
    "- *For those [Gemini principles] rated very difficult or extremely difficult to operationalize, what are the main challenges you face? (code: operationalization_challenges)\n",
    "- Would a visual tool that helps you demonstrate and communicate how your evidence-based assurance measures align with key ethical goals enhance trust in your digital twin(s)?\n",
    "    - If yes, what do you believe are the main benefits? (code: benefits_of_visual_tool)\n",
    "    - If no, why not? (code: reasons_against_visual_tool)\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify recurring themes and patterns within these responses, we employed a multi-stage coding strategy involving three independent coders.\n",
    "\n",
    "The content analysis was carried out as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 1 **Initial Coding** : Two coders independently reviewed and coded each response, applying multiple tags to capture the nuances of the data.\n",
    "- Step 2 **Code Alignment**: The two coders then discussed individual coding decisions, aiming to reconcile any discrepancies and streamline the codes. This collaborative process resulted in a reduced and harmonized set of codes.\n",
    "- Step 3 **Validation Coding**: The two coders and an additional third independent coder subsequently applied this refined code set to the data, ensuring an unbiased application of the codes and further validating the consistency of the analysis.\n",
    "- Step 4 **Compute Inter-coder reliability**\n",
    "- Step 5 **Code Alignment**"

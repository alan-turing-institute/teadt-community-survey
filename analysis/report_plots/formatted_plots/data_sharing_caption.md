Figure X: **Data Sharing and Perceived Trust Challenges**. This sunburst plot illustrates the relevance of data sharing within the digital twin community and the perceived difficulty in establishing trust when sharing data. The inner pie chart represents the ratio of responses to the question, "Have you considered sharing data or models with other organisations (or across partners within an organisation) to form connected digital twins?" with 55% answering "Yes" (blue) and 45% answering "No" (purple).
For those who responded "Yes" a follow-up question asked about the difficulty of establishing trust when partnering to build connected digital twins. Respondents could choose from six options, which were later consolidated into three categories: "Easy" (light blue), "Neutral" (light purple), and "Difficult" (dark blue). The light blue outer ring displays the percentage of these categories across all responses.

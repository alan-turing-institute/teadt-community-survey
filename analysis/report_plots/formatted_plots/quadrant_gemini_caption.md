Figure X: **Relative Perceptions of Gemini Principles.** This scatterplot compares the nine Gemini principles based on their average ratings across two dimensions: relevance and challenge. Each dot represents the average response for a principle across all survey responses, with the x-axis showing the level of challenge (increasing from left to right) and the y-axis showing the level of relevance (increasing from bottom to top). The principles are color-coded for identification: security (dark purple), quality (lighter purple), value (pink), insight (dark blue), public good (orange), federation (yellow), evolution (green/yellow), curation (teal), and openness (light blue). The crosshair marks the midpoints between the most extreme average values, providing a reference for how principles compare to one another.

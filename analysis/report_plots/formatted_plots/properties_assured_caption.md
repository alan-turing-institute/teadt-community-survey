Figure X: **Properties Considered When Assuring Digital Twinning Technology**. This chart presents the results of the multiple-choice question, "Which of the following properties (or goals) do you currently consider when assuring your (or your client's) digital twinning technology?" Respondents could select multiple options, and the bars are grouped into categories for readability: Technical Performance, Economic, Societal, Ethical, Legal & Regulatory, and Ecosystem Integration. Each category lists specific principles below the bar in the order corresponding to the stacked segments. The smallest sections represent additional principles specified by respondents who selected "Other." Note that these groupings are not the only possible categorizations and are used here to enhance the visualization.

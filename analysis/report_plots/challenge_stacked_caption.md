Figure X: **Gemini Principles Sorted by Difficulty.** The bar chart shows how respondents rated the difficulty of various Gemini principles in response to the question, "Please rate, for each of the following Gemini principles: How challenging is it to define and/or to know how to currently address it in practices?". Ratings were provided on a scale from "Extremely Challenging" to "Not at all Challenging," with blue shades representing higher amounts of challenge (Extremely, Very) and purple shades representing lower amounts of challenge (Slightly Challenging and Not at all Challenging). The stacked bars indicate the percentage of respondents who selected each level of challenge for each principle. The principles are sorted by the total number of responses indicating high amounts of challenge (blue shades), with those receiving more challenging ratings appearing at the top. The amount of responses for "Moderately challenging" are not displayed, however, across all principles this was the most frequently selected option.
